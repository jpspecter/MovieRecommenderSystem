# MovieRecommenderSystem
The goal of this project is to build a hybrid recommender system using feature hierarchies. Currently, the focus is on building a recommender system for movies. A fixed number of NLP concepts will be retrieved from the movie synopses. Then, a matrix of movie vs concepts will be created, and similarity between movies will be calculated using cosine similarity. This similarity will account for the content-based filtering aspect of the recommender system. We will also use user ratings in the algorithm to perform collaborative filtering.
